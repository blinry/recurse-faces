# Faces Contributors

Faces was originally conceived by [Jason Owen](https://github.com/jasonaowen)
in early 2017 as a way for members of the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) community to get to know their fellow
Recursers.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, provided feature ideas, helped
answer questions, participated in code reviews, and generally made Faces that
much better (listed alphabetically by first name):

* [Alberto Torres](https://github.com/botwhytho)
* [Fede Isas](https://github.com/fedeisas)
* [Gwendolyn Weston](https://gwendolyn.io/)
* [Jaryn Colbert](https://github.com/jaryncolbert)
* [Jason Owen](https://github.com/jasonaowen)
* [John Paul Ashenfelter](https://github.com/johnpaulashenfelter)
* [Sebastian Morr](https://github.com/blinry)
